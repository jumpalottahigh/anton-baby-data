Monitoring baby data: sleep, nursing, urination, tantrums

## Monitoring the vitals and activities of new borns is key to helping them grow healthy, and keeping the parent informed.

### The "backend" of the app is currently hosted on Firebase. Implementation from less technical users is tricky at this point, but this is in the works to make the app easier to use and openly available to interested parents.

### Right now, the way to use this is to fork it and host the static files. Make a free Firebase account, create an authenticated user, use the login button to login and then use the app.

## This is deployed in heroku and preview available at:
